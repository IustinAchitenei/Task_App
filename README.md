# Task_App
Simple python app that lets you save/delete/mark as done your tasks. You can chose what kind of task (agenda,short-term goal, long-term goal, meeting or deadline) you want to create. It saves the tasks locally, in a events.json file.

Clone the repo.
Run it with "python app.py". You will then be able to access the app on http://localhost:5000/.
